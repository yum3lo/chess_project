A simple **chess game** project using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, deployed using Netlify. 

This project is currently in a basic state and requires further development to be fully functional. While there are many potential improvements that could be made, such as implementing checkmate detection, adding a move history log, or creating an AI opponent, active development is not planned for the near future. You can play alone though!
